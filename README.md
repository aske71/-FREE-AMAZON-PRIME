2. Prime Student Amazon offers a Prime Student membership, which includes a 6-month free trial for college students. After the free trial, the membership continues at half the price of a regular Prime membership. To be eligible, you must verify your student status with a valid .edu email address. Prime Student includes most of the same benefits as a standard membership, such as free shipping and streaming services.

3. Amazon Household If you live with someone who already has an Amazon Prime membership, you can take advantage of Amazon Household. This feature allows you to share Prime benefits with another adult in your household at no extra cost. Both individuals will have access to Prime perks, including Prime Video, Prime Music, and more.
